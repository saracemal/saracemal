I am a Full Stack Software Engineer from NYC, specializing in React, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails!
<br>
<br>
Since my background was heavily shaped by providing efficient and quality service, I'm looking forward to delivering the same experience to future employers and clients. Problem solving and quick critical thinking, whether in a customer facing role or in coding, excite me and are what motivate me to strive for growth in my position.

<h3>fun facts ðŸŒ±</h3>
<b>I'm currently working on</b>: Creating a new personal project modeled after "Letterboxd" where users can share reviews on albums. (if you have specific requests, let me know! Always looking for new additions to projects).
<b>Hobbies</b>: watching/logging lots of movies (second mention of Letterboxd on my profile) playing geoguessr, fashion history, interior design (a sucker for vintage furniture), learning new languages, and sewing. recently learned about djing and producing music using code! ðŸ¤¯
